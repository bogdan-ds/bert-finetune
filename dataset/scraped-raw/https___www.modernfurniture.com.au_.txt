Your Online Furniture Store in Australia When it comes to contemporary style, there is a lot to explore at our online furniture store. We offer a wide range of design choices, from sofas and coffee tables, to office furniture and lounge chairs. We also offer a range of accessories, such as lamps, rugs and cushions, to complete the look. We’re an Australian family-owned business that designs and manufactures our own designer furniture, then delivers it nationwide. Here at our store, there are two main styles of furniture design: mid-century modern and contemporary. Mid-century style is characterised by its clean lines, simple forms, and natural materials. Contemporary furniture, on the other hand, is more often defined by its use of bold colours, patterns, and artwork, as well as cutting-edge materials. We celebrate both of these here at Modern Furniture. We travel the world looking for beautiful decor, with a range of timeless pieces crafted from quality materials. Browse our exclusive collection today. So Which is the Right Style of Furniture for You? It really depends on your personal taste and the overall aesthetic you're going for.
