A Vast Icon, the Samson Daybed is a simple design, beautifully executed. Crafted from solid mango hardwood, and hand finished with 4 coats of hard wearing NC lacquer, this daybed is designed to last for decades. While we sell many of these for inside use, it is also perfectly suited for a covered veranda. Click + Collect Click + Collect Flat Rate Delivery Flat Rate Delivery Ways to Pay Ways to Pay Key Features - Mango Timber The timber used in this piece is sustainably sourced Mango Wood. Each plank is individually treated in a computer controlled kiln to reduce the chance of any cracks or warping in its long future as a furniture component. This piece has been handcrafted by one of our Vast Masters, these individual cabinet makers have been manufacturing Vast products for over a decade. Using traditional joinery techniques to maximise the timber's natural beauty is a big part of the unique look of each Vast product. We call this "working with the grain". After the joinery is complete it is then hand sanded and hand polished with several coats of high grade German lacquer so it will last for generations! Country of Origin: India Product Care - Timber Hardwood is a natural material which reacts to its environment and although our manufacturing process allows for normal expansion and contraction, extreme high or low humidity may cause more swelling than normal. To minimise movement and ensure longevity of your purchase we recommend taking good care of your piece as outlined below: Dust regularly with a clean cotton cloth; Use tablecloths, table runners and coasters to help prevent  scratches to the surface and wipe up any spills immediately; To nourish and protect your furniture we recommend waxing with a natural beeswax every 6-12 months. Only use natural wax, oil or water based cleaning products. Do not use solvent based cleaning products that may contain silicone or alcohol, as this may react and permanently damage the lacquer. Do not expose to fragrant oils, insect repellent lotion, or nail polish remover as these are often solvent based and will damage the lacquer Avoid placing your furniture near fireplaces, in direct sunlight or under heating/cooling vents. Do not leave hot items or ice cold items directly on the surface of the table as water marking may occur. Any metal work featuring on your product has been powder coated. Any damage to the surface should be contained as soon as possible to prevent rusting.
