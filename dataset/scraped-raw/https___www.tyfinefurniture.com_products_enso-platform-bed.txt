Smooth, clean lines and gentle curves form this modern platform bed, encouraging quiet serenity. This piece bears some semblance to our Sunrise Platform Bed. But the top of the headboard curves into a very subtle concave, as inspired by the roofs in traditional Japanese architecture. The higher headboard enhances support for reading, laptop surfing, or working in bed. Moreover, it’s made of natural hardwood, as is the rest of the platform bed, so sturdy support is guaranteed. A solid wood frame of this caliber is truly one of a kind. It’s made of natural hardwood, which is harvested in Ohio’s managed forests. Plus, it’s finished with our propriety organic finish, produced from all-natural ingredients with zero VOC emissions. This makes the Enso Platform Bed and the rest of T.Y.
