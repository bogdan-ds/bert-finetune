Avoid using abrasive cleanser that may scratch the plastic. Use a tub/tile/sink cleaner; non-abrasive, all-purpose cleaner; or a paste of baking soda and water. Apply the cleaner to the surface or on a damp sponge and rub gently. The plastic injection moulding process produces large numbers of parts of high quality with great accuracy, very quickly. Plastic material in the form of granules is melted until soft enough to be injected under pressure to fill a mould. The result is that the shape is exactly copied. Kannoa products are UV Resistant, and in this case Recyclable. Simplicity and Style Designed for durability, practicality and style.
