See more Also available in Our signature solid Teak bench, exclusive for Living by Design in Australia. As featured on the front cover of Country Style Magazine, along with House and Garden editorial. A perfect blend of modern country meets simple nordic functionality. The clean solid teak lines, are very lightly oiled, from sustainably sourced wood. The organic nature of this product, along with its natural curved seat, ensures no two are the same. The hardware teak wood ensures this bench will withstand the test of time. Our Sorensen teak benches are superior quality, yet with teak there is always an allowance for knots or slight discoloration. Our design partners + manufacturers for hand cut and re-fill knots in the bench top... which is time consuming + expensive, but to Living by Design's specifications. All our teak tops vary in regards to this process, and as such we do not deem this to be a fault. An ideal bench for the narrow hallway, simple nook, or end of bed. Our expanded size range will ensure a perfect size is available. Our exclusive Sorensen Teak bench with its slender silhouette, is the ideal addition to large or small spaces.
