With Florence’s design skills and Hans’ business acumen and salesmanship, the pair, who married in 1946, grew the nascent company into an international arbiter of style and design. Florence also seeded contributions with her friends Eero Saarinen, Harry Bertoia, and Mies van der Rohe. read more Florence Knoll Florence Knoll Hairpin™ Stacking Table Florence Knoll™ Bench Florence Knoll™ Coffee and End Tables Florence Knoll™ Credenza Florence Knoll™ Dining Tables Florence Knoll™ Executive Desk Florence Knoll™ Lounge Chair NEW Florence Knoll™ Model 31 Lounge Chair NEW Florence Knoll™ Model 33 Sofa Florence Knoll™ Relaxed Benches Florence Knoll™ Relaxed Lounge Chair Florence Knoll™ Relaxed Sofa and Settee Florence Knoll™ Sofa and Settee Florence Knoll™ Table Desk NEW Florence Knoll™ Vertical Storage Here to Help Help CenterWarrantyPromotional Terms & ConditionsSign InCookie NoticePrivacy NoticeDo Not Sell My InformationAccessibility StatementGroup Health Plan DisclosureTerms of Use Workplace & Commercial Workplace HelpHow to PurchaseShowroomsDealer LocationsSales Teams Residential Residential HelpHow to PurchaseHome Design ShopsHome Design at the D&DVirtual Shop TourRetailer LocationsTrade Services Corporate Info Corporate HelpNewsroomSustainable DesignOriginal DesignCommunity ImpactCareersDiversity & InclusionInvestor RelationsKnoll International Join Us © Knoll Part of the MillerKnoll collective
