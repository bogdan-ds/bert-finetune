Description Designed with simplicity in mind, the Hoyt Chair is anything but basic. Keep conversations flowing by placing a pair of these chairs in a room. The square silhouette and smart lines look even better when two chairs sit together. Plush cushions, and padded bolsters (which are stitched in place to keep the arms looking crisp and comfortable) make this chair the perfect place to chat or just relax.
